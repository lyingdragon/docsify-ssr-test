BITBOX API Development Guide
BITBOX, a crypto-to-crypto exchange, provides APIs for programmatic crypto trading.

Using BITBOX API, you do not have to access the BITBOX website to check your account status, trading history, or to buy and sell crypto. You can also automate your trading orders based on set criteria, such as buying a set amount of coins when the price drops by more than 5%.

This document describes basic information about BITBOX API and provides detailed examples.
